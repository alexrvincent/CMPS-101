gps.c	   	       -main program that creates graph and takes queries	
graphDriver.c	   -a test program to ensure the correctness of the graph ADT
graph.c            -implementation for the graph ADT
graph.h            -header file for the use hash function explaining its use
list.c             -implementation of the list ADT
list.h             -header for list ADT explaining its functions and use
listdr.c           -a test program to ensure the correctness of the list ADT
Makefile           -Makefile used to compile programs into executeables
myinclude.h	       -David Helmbold's commonly used header files (used with permission)


COMPILING: You must type "make [file]" on the command line to create the executable. 
These are the 2 you can make:
		-"make" - makes gps.c, the main program
		-"make graphDriver"
		-"make listdr"
		
Ignore all warnings, they will not cause errors.
To run the main program, compile and type gps [test.in]
