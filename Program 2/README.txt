This directory contains the following files:

README.txt	-The documentation file
store.c		-The source code for a  small program
		that implements the List ADT.
List.h		-The header files describing the ADT Operations
List.c		-The implementation of the List ADT
Listdr.c	-A simple program that tests the ADT operations
Makefile	-Makefile that compiles the store OR the Listdr
		to create the store or Listdr executeable files
myinclude.h	-David Helmbold's personal header file that
		includes commonly used C headers and macros.


Using the store program:
	1.a) Compile using make (IGNORE THE WARNINGS)
	1) Run the store executable.
	2) The program will prompt for a file to be used, 
	   use a file in the current directory. Files
	   not in the current directory will be rejected
	   by the program and display an error message.
	3) Display will be outputted to STDOUT
